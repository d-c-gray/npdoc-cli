Doc Strings
===========
In addition to parsing function signatures, the module assumes
that your functions are documented with doc strings according to  the
|numpy style guide|_.

This tutorial goes over how to use the doc-strings to further customize
your CLI.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 11-14

.. code-block:: Python


    from npdoc_cli import cli








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 15-20

Summary
-------
The ``Summary`` and  ``Extended Summary`` of the doc string are converted into the
help message of your parser. The descriptions in the ``Parameters`` section
are converted into the help message for each argument

    cli.reset()
    @cli.program
    def hello(name: str, number: int):
        """
        This is a summary line.

        This is an extended summary line.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            This is a help message.
        """
        for i in range(number):
            print('hello', name)

    cli.print_help()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    usage: hello [-h] name

    This is a summary line. This is an extended summary line.

    positional arguments:
      name        This is a help message.

    options:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-52

Choices
-------
Sometimes a function expects specific choices.
You can include those in the ``Parameters`` section, and they will be 
added to the parser, which will check that a valid choice was passed
as a command line argument.

To do this, add a curly braces next to the doc strings type indication
formatted as ``{val2, val2, ...}`` where the first value is the default.
Each item in the choices will be cast into the type in the signature.

    def options(o: str = 'a'):

        args = cli.parse_args(['-o', 'd'])

Action, Nargs, and Required
---------------------------
Underhood the hood, the module is generating an |argparse argument|_ and
some settings
don't fit nicely into the signature or |numpy style guide|_. For those,
you can include them in the descriptions of the argument in the ``Parameters``
section.

These settings should be formatted as: 
``For CLI argument key = <val>, ...`` and ended with a period. The spaces and
period are important and must be included properly on a single line.

This line will not be included in the help message of the generated CLI.
